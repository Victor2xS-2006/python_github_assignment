Title: Week Estimate of Time Spent on School Work

Short Description: Takes how many hours you spent doing school work in a day
and multiplies it by 7 to find an estimate of how many hours you'll spend
doing school work that week, if this daily rate doesn't change. This makes you aware
of how much time you spend doing school work. You can then decide to increase these
hours or decrease them depending on your answer.

How to run:
type a number
python app.py

Example Output:
